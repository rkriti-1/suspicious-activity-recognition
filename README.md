# suspicious-activity-recognition

We will be creating a Long-term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN) based system for our living environment to monitor the CCTV footage and detect non-suspicious activities like - eating, walking & suspicious activity like — fighting. 

Methodology:

•	Load suspicious activity in living environment recognition data.
•	Pre-process the data.
•	Build LRCN Model for Classification.
•	Evaluate the Model.

We created an LRCN model for detecting activity like fighting, walking & running from CCTV footage of our living environment, the model was trained on 300 videos and achieved an accuracy of about 83%. 

Our model is able to detect suspicious activities like fighting in our living environment. But this is not the best model out there.
The model is not trained on further suspicious actions like — fainting, burglary etc. The model can still be improved by training it on more suspicious actions. As well as if code is run on high-end GPU it can be used to process CCTV footage in near real-time.

Overall, the completion of this project went quiet well. I enjoyed the process and learned many things through my journey.
